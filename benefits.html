											has been noted to be a critical part of learning in the early years as this
											is when children start to make sense of the world around them. Narrative conveys messages to us in relation to as Stephens (1992) terms it, being, becoming and belonging. Similarly, Mills and Exley (2014) note that stories assist children in becoming reading ready, a vital skill that carries them through the school years and beyond (p. 136). Other benefits of storytelling include: language acquisition, oral language development, social and cultural awareness, creativity and imagina tion, and communication										<p>
												A study carried out by Isbell, Sobol, Lindauer, & Lowrance (2004) for exam ple, compared the impact of storytelling and story reading on students' oral lan guage complexity and comprehension. They found that storytelling without the use of a text enabled the children to retell stories orally more effectively than if a storybook was only read to them, The researchers believed this was a result of the type of interaction usually engaged in between storyteller and the children It was also found that retelling stories through storyboarding was more effective for the story reading group. It was concluded that the heavy reliance on images from books as well as discussion with the teacher about these pictures could lead to this result. Therefore, this study found that both story reading and storytell ing were beneficial for language complexity and story comprehension, albeit in different Hur ways.</p>

												<h3>Study</h3>

												Huffaker's (2004) study explored the dialogic collaborations that occur between young people on the Internet. He argues that popular applications such as instant messaging and message boards including blogs assist children in shar ing their ideas and feelings. Ultimately, for Huffaker (2004), interactions on the Internet promote prosocial attitudes. Investigating digital platforms, he argues, encourages "different types of literacy, including verbal and visual skills, as well as digital flucncy" (p. 10). Ryokai, Vaucelle and Cassell had similar findings in their study on virtual literacies. They found that storytelling supported students in becoming facilitators of learning and gained them more autonomy in their It also allowed them to view narrative and problems from a range own progress. t perspectives through the assistance of of the assistance of multiple figurines											</p>

													Despite Flpite many studies showing the benefits of the use of storytelling in a range of learning activities, there is limited research on how extended approaches utilis ing storytelling in the classroom mng m the classroom impact on children's development. That is, no study has explored the use of storytelling over an extended period of time and as a privileged pedagogical choice of teachers. Nor has there been any study that has explored the impact of such approaches c on indigenous children's learning. This is troubling given that for indigenous children in particular storytelling is an inte gral part of cultural and social interaction. The chapter will now discuss the role that storytelling has in indigenous contexts and then offer some effective ways for educators to incorporate such approaches in educational contexts.</p>
