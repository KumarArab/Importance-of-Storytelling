											<h3>K’gari</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The digital story of K’gari gives two perspectives about what happened when Eliza Fraser was shipwrecked on K’gari (Fraser Island), which is the Country of the Butchella peoples. It invites viewers to ‘help destroy one of Australia’s first fake news stories’, and this is incorporated into interactive elements of the story. Using spoken and written words, images and music, the drama raises questions about perceptions, history-making and truth-telling. At the end of the tale there is a link to PDF teacher notes.</p>
