									<h2>Introduction</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
								Stories and storytelling have been an age old traditionacross communities and cultures. Stories act as a vehicle by which cultural practices and traditions are maintained over time but also equally important for young children's development. This chapter aims to explore the important role that stories paly in young children's lives including the many benifits the act of storytelling has on learing and development for indigenous children in particular. The chapter shares the concept that for indigenous communities, stories are a crucial part of cultural continuity and heritage. It will therefore argue that storytelling should be  a privileged pedagogical choice of teachers in schools for indigenous students. We show how planning learning and teaching around stories has many benifits for young children but is particularly important for young indigenous children.</p>

										<h3>Importance</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Stories play an important role in many communities and individual's lives (Barton & Barton, 2014), across the age spans (Rossiter, 2002: Swap, Leonard, Shields & Abrams, 2001) as well as in diverse disciplines (Davidson, 2004). In fact, McKcough et al. (2008) note that stories form a major part of social and cultural continuity, facilitating the passing of information from one generation to the next. Without stories, this knowledge would be lost. Stories act as a way of recounting an event or a way of explaining a series of actions by people in a particular context or setting. The purpose of telling stories can vary from enter taining through to conveying important information such as when conserving culture or communicating a particular point of view (Exley, 2010). According to Mills and Exley (2014), 'narrative plays a pivotal role in the socialisation of learners' (p. 136)
	
										Stories or narratives are central to any culture. An expert of early education, Jerome Bruner, has written a great deal on the role narrative plays in our lives, and in particular children's development. Bruner (1985) has noted that there are two modes of human thought. These are: Paradigmatic thought and narrative
										
										thought. The difference between these two modes is that paradigmatic thought is about categorising and conceptualising narural phenomena in an objective fashion, whereas narrative thought is subjective and about human actions and interactions.</p>
									
									<p>
										Through narrative we develop a deeper understanding of the social world of how others think, why they behave the way they do, and the implications people's actions hold for others. The stories we share of our life's experiences are shaped, in terms of content and organisation, by the stories others tell to us within our culture.Given stories are a significant part of people's lives, it makes sense that they con stitute a substantial portion of learning and teaching practices in schools. This is particularly so for indigenous children where stories and storytelling play a sig nificant role in developing their identity in the community. Mohd Roslan (2008), for example, provides a number of reasons as to why stories and storytelling should be utilised in classrooms. These include using stories<br><li>
											<ul>To illustrate a principle</ul>
											<ul>To stimulate other learining and actvity</ul>
											<ul>To engage in creative and imaginative learning</ul>
											<ul>To help explain abstract ideas or concepts</ul>

										</li></p>

										<h3>So in conclusion ...</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										So in conclusion, I just wanted to say that how simple we think storytelling is, its actually not that simple. Our ancestors have made it possble in various ways to transfer their thought to their future in various ways. And storytelling is one of them.</p>

									There was a keen interest from students in further learning specific culture and customs of the South Australian Indigenous Kaurna peoples. The ATSI team then surprise students with a clap sticks and didgeridoo musical performance.
									From there students then designed, carved and printed a three layer lino print of Australian animals influenced by indigenous stories and motifs.</p>
