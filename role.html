                                                most favoured pet? One day, Kangaroo and Emu were out looking around for food. They went to all the usual spots and there wasn't much new grass. As their hunger grew, Kangaroo and Emu decided to try looking by the river. The river always had good grass but Kangaroo and Emu had to be mindful of crossing parks with the Dingo whose country was beside the river on the way. As they were ou get separated Emn. You see Kangaroo wasn't paying travelling Кипригоо л i from Emm. Tous attention to stick with Emu but on finding that feed. He got distracted by a patch of fresh green grass just off the usual path to the river. Overcome with hunger, Kangaroo went straight to that grass. The grass looks really good just sitting there. It looked like no one bad ever eaten that before. Having lost His bearings and overcome with desire for the beautiful sweet grass, Kangaroo had strayed into Dingo country. In the meantime, Emu bad continued on to the river and was nowhere in sight. While Kangaroo ate unaware of his surroundings Dingo came along and saw Kangaroo on bis country alone without Emu. Dingo knew this was his chance to finally get Kangaroo. Dingo pounced on Kangaroo while he wasn't looking. It was a fierce fight and Kangaroo wasn't ready – it was too late to run nom Kangaroo got hurt badly and blood was spilt on his fur all over. Emu could hear Kangaroo crying out from down by the river and ran as fast as she could to save Kangaroo Dingo secing Emu coming - took off into The bush, The women also came and helped Kangaroo but they couldn't get the blood off his coat. Forever stained red to remind Kangaroo to stay on bis country and stick with his mob. This was now the red kangaroo got bis red cost and when Emu and Kangaroo got old they became the sun and the brightest evening star and have shone down on the lands of the Kalkadungu ever since.</p>
