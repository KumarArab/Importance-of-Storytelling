											<h2>Stories</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											play an important role in many communities and individual's lives (Barton & Barton, 2014), across the age spans (Rossiter, 2002: Swap, Leonard, Shields & Abrams, 2001) as well as in diverse disciplines (Davidson, 2004). In fact, McKcough et al. (2008) note that stories form a major part of social and cultural continuity, facilitating the passing of information from one generation to the next. Without stories, this knowledge would be lost. Stories act as a way of recounting an event or a way of explaining a series of actions by people in a particular context or setting. The purpose of telling stories can vary from enter taining through to conveying important information such as when conserving culture or communicating a particular point of view (Exley, 2010). According to Mills and Exley (2014), 'narrative plays a pivotal role in the socialisation of learners'</p>
										<p>
											Stories or narratives are central to any culture. An expert of early education, Jerome Bruner, has written a great deal on the role narrative plays in our lives, and in particular children's development. Bruner (1985) has noted that there are two modes of human thought. These are: Paradigmatic thought and narrative											
											thought. The difference between these two modes is that paradigmatic thought is about categorising and conceptualising narural phenomena in an objective fashion, whereas narrative thought is subjective and about human actions and interactions.</p>

												<h3>Narration</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Through narrative we develop a deeper understanding of the social world of how others think, why they behave the way they do, and the implications people's actions hold for others. The stories we share of our life's experiences are shaped, in terms of content and organisation, by the stories others tell to us within our culture												
											<p>
												Given stories are a significant part of people's lives, it makes sense that they con stitute a substantial portion of learning and teaching practices in schools. This is particularly so for indigenous children where stories and storytelling play a sig nificant role in developing their identity in the community. Mohd Roslan (2008), for example, provides a number of reasons as to why stories and storytelling should be utilised in classrooms. These include using stories</p>
											</p>
											<p>
												to illustrate a principle, to stimulate other learning and activity, to engage in creative and imaginative learning. to assist in developing a positive attitude towards teachers and schools, and to help explain abstract ideas or concepts. Not only is storytelling an appropriate approach as a teaching strategy but the benefits of such a pedagogy are extensive.

											<h3>Benefits of Storytelling</h3>

										<p>Storytelling has been noted to be a critical part of learning in the early years as this is when children start to make sense of the world around them.</p>
